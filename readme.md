# Image text translation using Google cloud services:
Image text translation using Google Cloud AI services - This solution is designed to extract text from images and translate it into English. Once you upload an image, if you hover your mouse over any word in the image, a tooltip will appear with the translated text in English. If you hover your mouse over a plain area that doesn't have any words, all the available text in the image will be displayed in English translation.
